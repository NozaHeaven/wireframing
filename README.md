# wireframing

## Introduction
Wireframing is the process of creating a visual blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. It helps designers, developers, and stakeholders understand the layout and structure before investing time in detailed designs or coding.

## Importance of Wireframing
Wireframing plays a crucial role in the **UI/UX design process** because it:
- **Defines the structure** of a page before adding visual elements.
- **Improves communication** between designers, developers, and stakeholders.
- **Identifies usability issues** early in the design process.
- **Saves time and effort** by reducing the need for major design revisions later.

By using wireframes, teams can ensure that a project is **well-structured, user-friendly, and aligned with business goals** before moving into the final design and development stages.
